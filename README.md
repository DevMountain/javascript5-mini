# Javascript 5 Mini Project

### Objectives
- Become more proficient in debugging while fixing common bugs.
- Add another skill to make your project amazing by learning how to use lodash.js. 

#### Steps
1. `cd` into app1 and run `npm install` to install dependencies. app1 is a react app that is currently broken. Use your debugging techniques to fix the app.

2. Repeat step 1 for app2, app3, and app4.

3. `cd` into `lodashPractice`. You will be completing each problem without using the lodash library, and then with the lodash methods. Further instructions are in the lodash.js file.
